3. Boot the linux/unix through USB. Get familiar with the directory structure.
Practice with ls, cd, mkdir, chmod commands - when in doubt search the web to find the answer.

31. Practice with grep, egrep commands = Look at the manual to see how to use these commands. (Read the first chapter in Beautiful Code about the development and implementation (in C) of a very simple grep https://github.com/onestraw/ebook/blob/master/09_other/%E4%BB%A3%E7%A0%81%E4%B9%8B%E7%BE%8EBeautiful%20Code.pdf 
 )

4. Install tree and get the directory structure.

5. In your Foundations of Computer Science class you learned about Regular expressions. (If you have not taken Foundations of Computer Science class, please talk to the instructor he will explain)  Please do all 
the practice problems given [here](http://regexone.com/) (moving over Interactive Tutorial in the top right corner will get this). For getting full credit do at least 7 problems.

51. Go through the tutorials [here] (https://regexcrossword.com/challenges/tutorial/puzzles/1) all the problems and at least four problems on beginner level [here](https://regexcrossword.com/challenges/beginner/puzzles/1 ).
