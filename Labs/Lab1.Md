201. Please read the 10 criteria of Open Source Definition http://opensource.org/osd and understand why they are important.

3. Boot the linux/unix through USB. Get familiar with the directory structure.
Practice with ls, cd, mkdir, chmod commands - when in doubt search the web to find the answer.

31. Practice with grep, egrep commands = Look at the manual to see how to use these commands. (Read the first chapter in Beautiful Code about the development and implementation (in C) of a very simple grep https://github.com/onestraw/ebook/blob/master/09_other/%E4%BB%A3%E7%A0%81%E4%B9%8B%E7%BE%8EBeautiful%20Code.pdf

4. Install tree and get the directory structure.

5. In the class we talked about Regular expressions. Please do all 
the practice problems given [here](http://regexone.com/) (moving over Interactive Tutorial in the top right corner will get this). For getting full credit do at least 4 problems.

6. Play with [Snap](http://snap.berkeley.edu/) or [CSDT](https://community.csdt.rpi.edu/) or
[Blockly](https://blockly-games.appspot.com/) - Create some thing using either of the first two or solve [this](https://blockly-games.appspot.com/maze?lang=en&level=10&skin=0) using blockly
